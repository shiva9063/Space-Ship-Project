🚀 Spaceship Titanic Classification Project

This project is based on the Spaceship Titanic challenge, where the task is to predict whether passengers were transported during the incident based on their onboard details.

📌 Project Overview

The notebook is divided into two main parts:

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values.

Created new features (e.g., extracted deck/number/side from Cabin).

Combined training and test data for consistency.

Model Building

Trained a classification model to predict passenger outcomes.

Prepared final cleaned dataset and submission file.
